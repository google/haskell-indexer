{-| Intermediate data structure from GhcAnalyser.
This will be transformed to actual Grok/Kythe schema.

We need to keep this relatively lightweight to avoid mirroring GHC AST
structures. The goal for now should be support for code browsing and
crossreferencing, _not_ faithfully mirroring exact types for static analysis.

Should not expose info about the producer (GHC), to make them switchable.

Should not make assumptions about the consuming backend for same reason.

-- | Distinguishing a plain reference from a call is traditional in imperative

-- following might be imprecise or even foolish.
--
-- Traditionally a call puts a new entry on the call stack.
-- But with partial application or lazy evaluation our runtime representation
-- is a call graph (with thunks as nodes) rather than a linear stack.
--
-- So here we instead resort to considering what a call means for the user.
-- An UI with code crossref support can typically display the call stack or
-- possible call chain of a function. This chain is expanded by the user to
-- discover sites that deal with that function - an example situation can be
-- debugging a problem or understanding new code.
--
-- Here we adopt a simplistic distinction - call is anything with at least one
-- argument application, the rest are reference. The frontend is free to
-- disregard this information and treat everything as calls or references
-- though.
